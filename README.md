This is my readme file I created with my first merge, and now I have added text to merge changes utilizing gitbash.

This is my tutorial on how to push changes with git

Start by using git add . 

Next, use git commit -m 'your commit message goes here'

Finally, use git push to send all your changes back to the main branch!
